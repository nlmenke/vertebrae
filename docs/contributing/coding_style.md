# Coding Style

For PHP, we are folling the standards set in the
["laravel" preset][pint-laravel-preset] for Laravel Pint with a few overrides.

For the frontend, we're using the default ESLint and Prettier configs from a
fresh Laravel (`laravel/vue-starter-kit`) installation.

As long as you run `pint`, `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before
submitting your code for review, you should be able to check off that checklist
item in your pull request.
