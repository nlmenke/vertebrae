# Issues

When creating a new issue, please make sure to follow the practices outlined in
this documentation. Otherwise, it will be closed without further review. Please
only create issues on GitHub as the GitLab repository is only being used to
test CI/CD pipelines and will not be monitored.

A new issue should use one of the templates provided:
- [bug](/.github/issue_template/bug-template.md)
- [question](/.github/issue_template/question-template.md)
- [suggestion](/.github/issue_template/suggestion-template.md)

Bug tickets include a section to describe the issue, steps to reproduce,
current and expected behavior, logs/screenshots, and possible fixes (if the
user has any ideas). Question tickets allow a user to ask a question about
the project. Suggestion tickets include a section to describe an issue, propose
a solution along with alternatives, and anything else that may help define the
issue we need to solve.
