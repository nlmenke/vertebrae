## Which Branch?

All features/bugfixes should be based off the `dev` branch. Since the purpose
of this repository is to be a start for larger projects, everything will be
merged into `master` shortly after it is approved and merged into `dev`; this
may change some day, but for now, `dev` should be the base for anything new.

## Code Styles

* PHP: [.php_cs](https://github.com/nlmenke/vertebrae/blob/master/.php_cs) -
these loosely follow PSR-12, with a few personal preference tweaks
* JS: [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/nlmenke/vertebrae/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) -
sort of following the same standards as PHP, but mostly personal preferences
* SCSS: [.stylelintrc.js](https://github.com/nlmenke/vertebrae/blob/master/.stylelintrc.js) -
just personal preferences - these may be terrible since I don't do much styling
